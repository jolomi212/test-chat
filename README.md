# test-chat

Hello there.
This task aimed to achieve a couple of things:

Create an "interactive" chat platform, without making use of a database.
Keep Chat history(in a file) until the user clicks on "log out", or stays away from the browser for over 30 minutes.

Deploy to any platform, which I did with https://testing-chat.000webhostapp.com/

One of the unresolved challenges I faced here, is that I was unable to find a way to resolve, was the fact that the chats in the file clears for all users, when any of the users log out, the chat history is lost for everyone. I would be looking to resolve that in due course, but I have been unable to,as at the time of this submission.
Also, I did not work on a comprehensive login/registration/validation system.
I just left it open to all, so that anyone can just test it's functionality, which i believe was the purpose of the task.

Thank you so much


N.B: Ther is a chance your browser (ON PC) could prevent the hosted link from opening, depending on your antivirus. I would encourage you to go ahead with opening it. It's an issue with free hosting on webhost. I haven't yet observed a similar problem on mobile devices, though.
